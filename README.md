to test scenario

This is just for me to learn how to test. 
If you want to use it, the best way is to use the original information which can be found from 
[Scenario in Github](https://github.com/webautotester/wat/tree/master/scenario)
 or [Scenario in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wat_scenario)
